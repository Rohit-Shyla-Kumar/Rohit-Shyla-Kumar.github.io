                    <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Welcome to my final year project blog, "Adventures in teaching bots how to kill people". This is where I document my thoughts and milestones while working on my final year project at the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong. I update this page at least once a week in the form of chapters. My final goal for this project, titled "AI For General FPS" is a fairly bot capable of playing at the level of playing multiple different FPS games at the level of an average human player. </p> <br/>

                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you follow developments in the AI field closely, you've probably already seen the Dota 2 match between Open AI bot and Dendi. In case you haven't, check it out <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U4-wvhgx0w style="color:blue">here.</a></p>
                <br><p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Well, if I was going to pull off anything even close to this crazy, I'd need to find out what I'm up against first, so I started going through some of the literature on the topic, this is pretty much the very least you should be familiar with if you want to do something like this yourself.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Now to the deep end, literally. Q-learning is fairly intutive, I was able to pick it up pretty fast and so should you. The basic concept is, we give our "agent" some reward for certain special states and ask it to evaluate a "policy" to maximize its score. Now I know this all sounds super techincal but it's really not. It's literally just the Markov equation evaluated with a max function from any standard library.
                  This kind of agent can solve a simple maze of a few hundred to few thousand grids easily. Quick sidenote, if you're wondering what Dynammic Programming has to do with any of this or why I linked you to that particular paper, it's because DP is father of a technique called memoization. When the agent is working it's way through the maze, you'll to memoize and update the Q values in a table the size of the maze.
                 </p><br/>
                 <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Deep Q-Learning is where the challenge really begins. For this you're gonna need to know what Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks are. At this point I'd link a ton of resources to learn about them for your reference but I'm sure you don't need my help finding tutorials on the biggest buzzword of decade. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk" style="color:blue"> Here's </a> just one quick 4 part video series that I thought was brilliant.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">We have some basic understanding of neural networks and reinforcement learning, now we need to sort out the non-machine learning stuff. First off, even if out bot knew how to play an FPS game, how would it? Making a physical robot to press buttons on a keyboard is obviously not a viable option. </p>
                <br><p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">What we need is an environment where my bot can play with direct access to the game’s controls. Thankfully, people have considered this problem before and built environments for some of the more popular game. OpenAI has a wonderful environment to train and test bots called OpenAI Gym. It covers a lot of Atari games and most importantly, for our purpose, Doom. Since the FPS genre started with Doom, I may as well start with Doom too. If you want to learn more about the OpenAI gym environment, please refer to the below research paper. </p>

                <br/>
                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">There’s also been some research on bots that can play Quake 3, another game that absolutely defined the genre. Find out more <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01281.pdf" style="color:blue">here</a>. These environments are open source and thus the best place for me to start as compared to writing my own code to run on top of the game for my bot to access the controls and receive rewards.

                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Thanks to the environments, all I need is a program that can make decisions on which action to play given some video input. These actions are typically indexed by numbers, for example, 0 might be to press the W key and move forward and so on. Of course, analysing video feed is no simple task for a computer, in fact, until recently this component of the project alone was considered worthy of international awards. For this task, we must make use of a convolutional neural network to process the images (video feed is just images played at several frames per second). Since we’ll be working with multiple games, our architecture must be ready to accommodate multiple convolutional nets that perform image segmentation and recognition, one for each game to be precise. </p>
                <br><p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">We’ll also need an LSTM layer or some other recurrent architecture to accommodate time delayed rewards from the system. Now, if you’re wondering what that means, take a look at this paper on <a style="color:blue" href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf">Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning by Volodymyr Mnih (2016) </a> </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">So, our plan of action is build an deep reinforcement learning system that receives as input the positions of various items of interest in the scene as a vector and outputs the Q values for each action. We then select an action either based on a softmax or an adaptive epsilon greedy strategy. We have a separate convolutional neural network for each game so it’s easier to tag items that look different in different games.

                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7"> When it comes to programming, there’s no better way to learn that by just trying things out so now that we have a fair idea of how to approach this task, we should start writing some code to model the outlined architecture. First, let’s install the necessary tools and libraries needed for the task, starting with an environment. Since I’m working with <a href= "https://www.python.org/" style= "color:blue">  Python </a>on the Windows platform, I’ll install <a href= "https://www.anaconda.com/download/" style= "color:blue"> Anaconda </a> for Windows and create a virtual environment to act as a container for the project. To create a virtual environment, use the command <strong> conda create -n venv pip python=3.6 </strong> where venv is the name of your environment.  </p>

                <br><p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7"> The libraries we need include numpy, scikitlearn, pandas, tensorflow (running on the GPU preferably), keras and opencv. To save you the trouble, I created a <a href= "/assets/requirements.txt" style= "color:blue"> requirements file </a>that you can download and install using the command <strong> pip install requirements.txt </strong></p>
                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7"> Numpy, scikitlearn and pandas are mostly for manipulating desirable datatypes like numpy arrays and dataframes while Tensorflow and Keras can be used to build the neural networks we require. OpenCV will help us process images efficiently.   </p><br/>

                <p class="mbr-text align-left mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7"> Finally got assigned a computer at the CS lab in Mong Man Wai Building which is great because I can officially start development in a dedicated space. Of course, I’d have to reinstall all the software and libraries onto my new system. I decided to install Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution on this PC so I could test my code on multiple platforms. Let’s just hope this doesn’t come back to bite me in back. So, I got to work flashing the OS, connecting to the new network and installing the dependencies on my new machine. Most of the process remains the same as detailed above, however, since I’m working on Linux, I can create virtual environments from the command line and Python comes preinstalled, so I didn’t have to install Anaconda. </p>
